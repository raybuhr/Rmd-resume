### Summary

I'm a curious and skeptical quantitative analyst with experience in the entire lifecycle of data, from collection to modeling to communicating results. My background using data science in consulting and software products gives me a unique set of analytical and problem-solving tools ideal for modern businesses.

### Skills and Competencies

-   Passionate about creating reproducible research through code and infrastructure, and developing advanced analytical solutions using cutting edge technologies.
-   Extensive experience using traditional SQL databases, as well as NoSQL, and modern data warehouse technologies like Redshift, BigQuery, Spark, Drill and Presto.
-   Proficient programmer in Python and R, with some experience in Scala, Ruby, and Go.

### Data Science Projects

**Lead Scoring**

-   Enhanced data from CRM (Salesforce) and transactional database (MySQL) with data from US Census Bureau and other demographics vendors, then fed into a Random Forest classifier trained to segment leads by probability to convert.
-   The revamped lead scoring method for the sales team led to easier identification of which prospects could be more easily converted and resulted in 50% reduction in unsuccessful phone calls and thus increased time in the day for new lead generation.

**Brand Associations**

-   Used association rules and apriori algorithm to group brands together by which other brands their customers also purchased.
-   Automated data pipeline and dashboard of results for marketing team, which enabled on demand email campaigns and enhanced conversion rate 5-10x (by brand) over previous strategy obtained from external consultants.

**Financial Forecasting**

-   Combined functional system model with markov processes with ARIMA time series model to predict both marketplace listings and sales inventory within a 95% confidence interval.
-   System model represented the business processes that may or may not occur depending on preceding events, which helped provide better understanding of why fluctuations in daily financials occurred and smoothed out future forecasts enabling for more effective budgeting.
